# What is Battleground Europe Game Monitor?
BEGM is a third party external game monitoring utility for the MMO Battleground Europe (formerly World War 2 Online). It provides access to a wide range of information about the game in a friendly and easy to navigate format. It is designed for those that want to check out what’s been happening without having to start the game up or those that want to keep an eye on things while at work away from the action. It’s also useful for commanding officers that need to know what’s going on around them or anyone that needs that extra edge in battlefield intelligence while playing online.

Using BEGM you can keep track of significant game events including captures, attack objectives, firebase changes, brigade movements, and factory damage. It allows you to see at a glance what has been happening in the past couple of hours and where the current battles are. You can drill down to details on the facilities within a specific town or scroll around the game map to get the bigger picture. Factory bombers can see reports and graphs of the past 24 hours factory production and damage, from overall side summaries down to each individual factory. You can choose to be notified of important events or follow an attack with pop-up alerts – select the events you want to be notified for by a combination of town, country and event type (say, Antwerp, Germany, Spawnable Depot Captured).
